# The Bar Abacus

The Bar Abacus is an application built with React and Javascript. The Bar Abacus allows you to inventory liquors and mixers for a bar and use that data to mock up a cocktail and adjust it's price

## Installation

Clone the repository at https://github.com/njsilas/The-Bar-Abacus.
Once you have finished that. Run npm install. To use the database this application requires, please clone and install https://github.com/njsilas/TBA_backend

## Usage
This application was designed for restaurateurs to be able to log their inventory and see a price per ounce of the mixer or liquor they log. It stores these in the Rails API and allows the user to access this data to mock up drinks and see what margins would be based off of selected prices.

## Support
Please reach out to njsilas@gmail.com if you are experiencing any issues

## Roadmap
I have been very excited to bring this application to life. A few
additions I will be making in my spare time are as followed. I plan on importing Michigan's database of liquors to act as my liquor model. This will give the user the availability to access real prices of liquors to ensure they are accurate before constructing drinks to price out.I also plan on adding a feature to save a drink to the database.
